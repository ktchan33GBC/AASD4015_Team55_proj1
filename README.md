Introduction:

For this project we would use the CIFAR10 dataset

We first import VGG16 pretained model, and fine tuned the architect for our dataset. and we compare mparing the accuarcy and speed of the models


*   Model 1a: Training from the Fully Connected Network onwards
*   Model 1b: Un-freezing & training on the LAST CNN block onwards
*   Model 1c: Un-freezing & training on the LAST TWO CNN block onwards
*   Model 2 : unfreezing the last fully connected layers and the last 2 blocks together
